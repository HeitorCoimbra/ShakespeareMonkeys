Genetic Algorithm applied to the Shakespeare Monkey theorem.

There's an old theorem called the Shakespeare Monkey Theorem and it suggests that, with an infinite amount of time, a monkey randomly typing at a typewriter could actually recreate the famous writers's works.

This project has the goal of simulating a population of randomly generated Prompts and, by using a Genetic Algorithm and artificial decentralized selection and reproduction system, evolve the population to a point in which some of the monkeys have written exactly the inputted Prompt.
